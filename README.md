Project Summary: Indian Fashion Visualizer ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

This project is an AI-powered fashion design visualisation tool built using Streamlit and Imagen 4, specifically tailored for the Indian fashion market. It allows users to generate high-quality images of traditional and contemporary Indian garments by providing structured, descriptive input.


Key Features and Technology

Core Technology: The application uses Google's Imagen 4 as the generative AI model, accessed through the Vertex AI SDK for Python. This model is responsible for creating detailed, photorealistic images from text prompts.

User Interface (UI): The front-end is built with Streamlit, a Python framework that makes it easy to create interactive web applications without complex web development. The UI is designed to be intuitive for a fashion designer.


Structured Prompting: Instead of a single text box, the app breaks down the design process into specific categories relevant to Indian fashion. Users can select:


Occasion (e.g., Wedding, Festival)


Garment Type (e.g., Saree, Lehenga, Sherwani)


Fabrics (e.g., Silk, Brocade, Velvet)


Embellishments (e.g., Zardozi work, Mirror work)


Background Scene (e.g., Indian palace, a city street)


Functionality: The user's selections are programmatically combined into a detailed prompt that is sent to the Imagen 4 model. The app can generate multiple images at once and includes a gallery feature to save and organize favorite designs, creating a digital portfolio.
